### 🔧 Task 1: Update "Carrie Search" in Stripe

Wait for the client to confirm the new name ("Pete AI" or "Pete Search") via chat.  
Once received, log in to the Stripe portal and replace all occurrences of **"Carrie Search"** with the confirmed name in the relevant product fields (e.g., product name, description, metadata).
